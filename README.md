# LifeSteal Plugin

A lightweight, highly configurable Minecraft plugin introducing a **LifeSteal mechanic**. Perfect for servers of any size, from small communities to large-scale networks!

### This is the Main Version (The first version with SIMPLE and duped bugs LifeSteal)
### Use Version 2 for more fun and no dupes

## Features
- **LifeSteal Mechanic**: Players gain hearts by defeating others in PvP.
- **Heart Items**: Withdraw hearts into items and redeem them later.
